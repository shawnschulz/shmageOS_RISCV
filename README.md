# shmageOS

One day shmageOS will be an experimental operating system using a partitioned global address space memory model for parallel programming and a pooled distributed database file system. For now though, it's just me fighting with the linker and being really confused at the RISCV manual.

Many parts getting started are adapted from Stephen Marz's excellent tutorial on building a RISCV operating system in rust: https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/
